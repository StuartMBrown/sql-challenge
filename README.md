# PH, thanks to Jacob Dolinsky for assistance
The data containing employee and department information were imported from several CSVs. Through a PostgreSQL database I created several tables to illustrate a series of relationships between employees and departments. The PHSQL folder contains tables setup, a relationship diagram and pgerd importer, and various queries of interest. The Starter_Code 5 folder contains our data, commissioned for Pewlett-Hackard by Mockaroo, LLC in 2022.

The following SQL queries piqued my interest:

-Managers of all departments along with their departments' numbers and names, the managers' employee number, last name, and first name

-Each employees' employee number and department number, their first and last name and the name of their department

-First and last names and sexes of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last names begin with B

-All Sales department employee first and last names, and their employee numbers

-Numbers, first and last names, and department names of all employees in both the Sales and Development departments

-The frequency counts in descending order of all employee last names
